But sometimes I have been struggling with styling my [HandlebarJS](https://handlebarsjs.com/) HTML templates. Hopefully, I realized I could take advantage of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to generate outstanding visualization without much effort. Let's see that with [The 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) in its [GraphQL](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs/#overview--graphql) version.",

						"description": "The request body contains a GraphQL query requesting \"the name, desc(ription) and rarity name of all magic items\". We'll use the exact same query for all requests. Note that I do not recommend using abbreviations in property names (or whatever names) when designing APIs. Abbreviations make APIs harder to use. In that case, it looks really awkward because it seems there are no other abbreviations used in the entire API, all names are cristal clear full names. And yes, spotting the only \"mistake\" in an otherwise well-designed API is my super-power (or my curse ðŸ˜…). Hopefully, as Postman loads the GraphQL schema, it proposed me \"desc\" when I started to type \"des(cription)\" in my query. (But that's not a reason to underestimate the importance of design for GraphQL APIs.)\n\nOk, this digression on design aside, according to how GraphQL works and to the [documentation](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs/#get-/api/magic-items/-index-), that means we'll get a list of objects `data.magicItems` containing a string `name`, an array of string `desc`, and an object `rarity` containing a string `name`.\n\nThe visualization magic stands in the Test script. It defines a basic [HandlebarJS](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template and then passes it to the Postman visualizer along with the data to use (the list of magic items). The template contains an HTML table with an `{{#each}}` loop on its rows. On each row, we have the name, rarity name, and the first line of description of each magic item. After sending the request, the HTML result is visible by clicking on the \"Visualize\" button in the response's \"Body\" tab.\n\n![](https://apihandyman.io/postman-images/use-bootstrap-in-visualizer/use-bootstrap-in-visualizer-1.png)"
